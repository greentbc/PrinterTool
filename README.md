# PrinterTool
Custom macOS application used to instal printers, drivers and print presets. A tool for end users and IT support. 

Xcode project is in CompassPrinters. This is no longer in development as I am not currently managing large amounts of printers and printer installs. Used with macOS 10.12 Sierra to 10.14 Catalina. Not tested or used with macOS 11, Big Sur.

Features:
- Install needed drivers and set specific configuration settings for multifunction printers nationally.
- Install standardized print presets 
- Allows for end user set up without needing to assume 
- Two click install of all printers at location. (One click is to confirm install.)


Subfeatures:
- Replace the national print presets with regional settings. (Cloned from a computer with the desired presets.)
- Updatable list if all office and printer locations. (Able to import the from the central database we used company wide.) 


In development tasks:
- Automatic updating of printer driver, presets, and printer location database. 
- UI redesign (more end user focus rather than IT staff focus)
